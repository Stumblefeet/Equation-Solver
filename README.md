# Equation-Solver
A Java program that solves simple equations.

The program was created to give my pupils an easy way to train equation solving. 
They make up an equation, try to solve it and then use the equation solver to test their technique.

The next goal is to clean up the code and introduce 
-parantheses
-more than one variable
-fractions
